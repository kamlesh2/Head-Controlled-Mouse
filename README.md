# Head-Controlled-Mouse


ðŸ’  This project was a mix of hardware and software. 

ðŸ§© This repository contains a project report. It has code, a prototype, some of the canvas work, and a conclusion.

ðŸ¦½ As this project was to make a computer mouse that can be controlled by the head the project was done by keeping in mind the people who are handicapped from the shoulder and below.
